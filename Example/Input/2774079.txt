food was scarce. The species was present in small numbers from 

 Labrador to Greenland and then common up the coast to Franz 

 Josef Fjord, the most northern point visited. The center of abun- 

 dance, however, was in south Greenland outside the ice-pack, which 

 they seemed to shun. 



Only a single stomach of the Atlantic form had previously been 

 examined in the laboratory of the Biological Survey (Cottam, 1936, 



; p. 167). Consequently, it was gratifying to obtain 13 stomachs and 

 gullets for the present study. All but one were full or nearly so, and 



'" all were taken from birds collected at sea during the latter half of 

 off the south and east coasts of Greenland, from about 64 to 67 

 N. Lat. and 39 W. Long. The birds are omnivorous feeders, accept- 

 ing carrion, fish, squids, polychaete worms, or steamer refuse with 

 almost equal relish. A summary of the food, expressed in percentage, 1 

 of 12 Atlantic Fulmars, is as follows:

JL From the table, it is apparent that the Atlantic Fulmar consumes 

 w a wide variety of pelagic life. Its chief role seems to be that of a 

 scavenger, as carrion aggregated 28.41 per cent of the total food 

 consumption, and occurred in seven of the 12 birds examined. 

 Little preference appeared to be shown for the type of carrion in- 

 gested, as seals, birds, and terrestrial mammals were all recognized 

 JJ in the stomach contents. Fish foods aggregated 21.67 per cent of the 



1 Laboratory analysis is based on volumetric method, which is the standard 

 long used by the United States Biological Survey.
