FOOD HABITS OF SOME ARCTIC BIRDS 

 AND MAMMALS 



BY CLARENCE COTTAM' AND HAROLD C. HANSON* 



During the summer of 1936, under the leadership of Captain 

 R. A. Bartlett, an expedition sponsored by the Chicago Zoological 

 Society, with the junior author as ornithologist and mammalogist, 

 sailed from New York on June 23 and returned September 4, after 

 visiting Newfoundland, Labrador, and Greenland. During this 

 expedition the stomachs of 98 birds of 23 species and of eight mam- 

 mals of five species were collected. These have been carefully 

 analyzed in the Food Habits Laboratory of the United States Biologi- 

 cal Survey. Notes were made of other species encountered. Although 

 the number of stomachs is limited, the results of their examination 

 given in the present paper may be of more than ordinary interest 

 since they concern a phase of far northern ornithology, of which, 

 current information is extremely meager. Laboratory analysis in the 

 Biological Survey had never before been made of alimentary material 

 of a number of the species here treated. A report on the food of 

 certain birds and mammals collected by attendants of the Bartlett 

 expeditions of 1931, 1932, and 1933 (Cottam, 1936, pp. 165-177) 

 seems to be the only other publication devoted to similar material. 



Grateful acknowledgment is made to Messrs. Clarence F. Smith, 

 F. H. May, Leon H. Kelso, A. L. Nelson, C. S. Williams, F. M. 

 Uhler, A. C. Martin, J. R. Malloch, and the Misses Alma M. Swords 

 and Phoebe Knappen, members of the Food Habits Staff of the 

 Biological Survey, for assisting either in actual stomach examinations 

 or in the identification of certain food items. Dr. Waldo Schmitt, 

 Mr. Clarence Shoemaker, and Dr. Harold Rehder of the United 

 States National Museum also assisted in identifying certain crus- 

 tacean and molluscan food items. The junior author is especially
