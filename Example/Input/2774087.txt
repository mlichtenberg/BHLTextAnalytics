good share of its diet is probably carrion, as birds were often seen 

 feeding upon seal carcasses left by the Norwegian sealers. 



Stercorarius parasiticus (Linnaeus). PARASITIC JAEGER. 



The single specimen of the Parasitic Jaeger taken August 3, on 

 Ymer Island, suggests food habits similar to the Pomarine Jaeger, as 

 its stomach also contained only the remains of four pollack fish (Pol- 

 lachius virens). This bird is probably the rarest of the jaegers in 

 northeast Greenland as evidenced by the fact that a pair seen at 

 Ymer Island were the only individuals of the species encountered. 



Stercorarius longicaudus Vieillot. LONG-TAILED JAEGER. 



It was perhaps fortunate that as many as an even dozen stomachs 

 of the Long-tailed Jaeger were collected on their breeding grounds, 

 as their examination considerably modifies our conception of the 

 feeding habits of this bird during the nesting season. The birds were 

 all taken by Hanson at Musk-Ox Fjord, Hudson Land, northeast 

 Greenland, on July 31. 



This jaeger is very common in northeast Greenland. Flocks of 

 eight and ten trailing after Kittiwakes were of frequent occurrence 

 while the expedition was cruising along the coast. In the northern 

 fjords, perhaps because of the absence of Kittiwakes, these birds 

 forage a great deal for themselves. It was a common sight to see 

 them hunting lemmings by hovering over the tundra, much in the 

 manner of sparrow hawks. Three young in full plumage were 

 collected on July 31, one of which was an example of the light phase.
